            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced professional in the field of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) with over 17 years of hands-on expertise. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to enhancing the product development process and driving innovation through technology.</p>
            
            <p>My journey in the PLM domain began with Dassault's 3DEXPERIENCE platform, where I've accumulated a comprehensive understanding of its various modules and capabilities. I have successfully managed and contributed to projects involving Enovia PLM, SAP PLM, and other cutting-edge solutions.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am expanding my skillset to include Python programming, data science, and AI technologies like ChatGPT and Rasa. I'm excited to leverage these skills to create more intelligent and efficient PLM systems that will shape the future of product development.</p>
            
            <p>As a Systems Manager at ELGi Equipments, I lead a team in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, overseeing the implementation and optimization of PLM processes. My previous roles at renowned companies like Tech Mahindra, Xchanging Solutions, and Capgemini have equipped me with a strong foundation in project management, technical architecture, and ITIL support.</p>
            
            <p>I believe in continuous learning and have a proven track record of adapting to new technologies and methodologies. My commitment to excellence, paired with my extensive experience, allows me to analyze complex systems, devise innovative solutions, and drive forward-thinking strategies in the PLM landscape.</p>
